prompt = """
Analyze the provided code for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. Conduct a thorough review covering:

## Areas to Analyze

1. **Database & Data Access**
 - N+1 query problems and missing eager loading
 - Lack of database indexes on frequently queried columns
 - Inefficient joins or subqueries
 - Missing pagination on large result sets
 - Absence of query result caching
 - Connection pooling issues

2. **Algorithm Efficiency**
 - Time complexity issues (O(n²) or worse when better exists)
 - Nested loops that could be optmized
 - Redundant calculations or repeated work
 - Inefficient data structure choices
 - Missing memoization or dynamic programming opportunities

3. **Memory Management**
 - Memory leaks or retained references
 - Loading entire datasets when streaming is possible
 - Excessive object instantiation in loops
 - Large data structures kept in memory unnecessarily
 - Missing garbage collection opportunities

4. **Async & Concurrency**
 - Blocking I/O operations that should be Async
 - Sequential operations that could run in parallel
 - Missing Promise.All() or current execution patterns
 - Synchronous file operations
 - Unoptimized worker thread usage

5. **Network & I/O**
 - Excessive API calls (missing request batching)
 - No response caching strategies
 - Large payloads without compression
 - Missing CDN usage for static assertions
 - Lack of connection reuse

6. **Frontend Performance**
 - Render-blocking JavaScript or CSS
 - Missing code splitting or lazy loading
 - Unoptimized images or assets
 - Excessive DOM manipulations or reflows
 - Missing virtualization for long lists
 - No debouncing/throtting on expensive operations

7. **Caching**
 - Missing HTTP caching headers
 - No application-level caching layer
 - Absence of memoization for pure functions
 - Static assets without cache busting

**Output Format**
For each issue identified:
1. **Issue**: Describe the performance problem
2. **Location**: Specify file/function/line numbers
3. **Impact**: Rate severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low) and explain expected performance degradation
4. **Current Complexity**: Include time/space complexity where applicable
5. **Recommendation**: Provide specific optimization strategy
6. **Code Example**: Show opmitized version when possible
7. **Expected Improvement**: Quantify performance gains if measurable
Write a markdown file for each issue identified with all relevant information in a "performance-check" folder.

If code is well-optimized:
 - Confirm optmiziation status
 - List performance best practices properly implemented
 - Note any minor improvements possible
